# Node.js Tests
A collection of small test projects exploring JavaScript development involving
Node.js
* [Magnetometer](./magnetometer/): An unpolished proof-of-concept web app that
runs on Android Chrome to query data from integrated magnetometer and displays
that data as a virtual compass needle rendered with [three.js](https://threejs.org/).
This evolved to a more refined
[Compass web app](https://github.com/Roger-random/compass)
* [webpack demo](./webpack-demo/): Started by following webpack's "Getting
Started" guide and after that, it serves as a playground for webpack features.
