# Node.js Tests
A collection of small test projects exploring JavaScript development involving
Node.js
* [Magnetometer](./magnetometer/): An unpolished proof-of-concept web app that
runs on Android Chrome to query data from integrated magnetometer and displays
that data as a virtual compass needle rendered with [three.js](https://threejs.org/).
This evolved to a more refined
[Compass web app](https://github.com/Roger-random/compass)
* [webpack demo](./webpack-demo/): Started by following webpack's "Getting
Started" guide and after that, it serves as a playground for webpack features.
* [hello-vue3](./hello-vue3/): The "Quick Start" project of
[Vue application framework](https://vuejs.org/guide/quick-start.html).
* [hello-vite](./hello-vite/): "Scaffolding Your First Vite Project" example of
[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project)

--

* [docs](./docs/): Subdirectory whose content will be statically served via
[GitHub pages](https://roger-random.github.io/nodejs_tests/).
Has the build output of whatever I was using most recently.
